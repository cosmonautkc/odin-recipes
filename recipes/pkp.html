      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="steps">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prepare shallots, garlic (and chicken if chosen)
            <ul>
              Dice the shallots and finely chop the garlic. If you chose to use
              chicken, cut it into small chunks, you can break them up more in
            </ul>
            <ul>
              the pan to cook faster, so don't worry about their initial size.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the ingredients
            <ul>
              Add some butter to your pan, then add the shallots and stir on low
              heat, once they become a translucent, add the garlic and keep
            </ul>
            <ul>
              frying until you can see the garlic turn a deeper colour, slice
              the chillis and add to the pan stirring until fragrant.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the meat to the pan
            <ul>
              Add and combine the meat with the ingredients in the pan, stir and
              turn the heat up to medium.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Add sauces to the pan
            <ul>
              Once the meat is 80% cooked, add the fish sauce, thick soy sauce
              and oyster sauce to the pan and combine with ingredients.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Chop the basil
            <ul>
              Once chopped, you can add this to the pan, and stir it into the
              sauce.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Add sugar, MSG and salt
            <ul>
              Add these ingredients to taste, depending on whether you want a
              sweeter sauce, more of a salty sauce or an even mix. If you prefer
            </ul>
            <ul>
              more sauce, add some water and let this reduce for 5-7 minutes.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry your egg
            <ul>
              In another pan, add butter and turn the heat up to medium/high,
              once heated, crack an egg and fry until it has a crispy brown
              bottom.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Plate your food up
            <ul>
              And enjoy! Best served with a rice base.
