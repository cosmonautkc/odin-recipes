Overview:

In this project, I am going to be building a basic recipe website using HTML. There will be a main index page, with
links to a few recipes I have chosen. Using HTML, I am going to demonstrate using links, images, various different
tags and elements, attributes, and fundamental knowledge and structure of a HTML webpage.

Objectives:
- Add images and the correct attributes "src" and "alt"
- Link at least 3 recipe webpages to the main index page
- Compose ordered and unordered lists for the ingredients and for the recipe steps
