# odin-recipes

Overview:

In this project, I am going to be building a basic recipe website using HTML. There will be a main index page, with
links to a few recipes I have chosen. Using HTML, I am going to demonstrate using links, images, various different
tags, elements, attributes, and fundamental knowledge and structure of a HTML webpage.

Objectives:

- Add images and the correct attributes "src" and "alt"
- Link at least 3 recipe webpages to the main index page
- Compose ordered and unordered lists for the ingredients and for the recipe steps

Post Project Thoughts and features:

I really enjoyed this project, I have had fun building webpages using HTML. I achieved all my objectives, and I added features such as links back to the homepage and links to the top of the webpage for UI/UX. This project has solidified my HTML knowledge and got me into the rhythm of committing my work and giving myself good check points. Though the hardest part about it was probably the commit messages, I have tried to keep them conventional and concise as best I can. The easiest part was the boilerplate, I'm sure I could write the code in my sleep now, I've had plenty practice. One thing I want to work on is probably the format of my code and learning how to structure it best without massive amounts of help from a code formatter extension.

Peace

Thank you to The Odin Project
